## 📖 About MarketX

**MarketX** is an ambitious open-source marketplace backend engineered for scale, fraud resistance, and lightning-fast developer experience. Designed initially to power peer-to-peer (P2P) commerce, it provides an expansive suite of tightly coupled e-commerce micro-features.

We are currently undertaking a massive open-source contribution wave (via **Drips**) to fortify the architecture, refactor technical debt, and build out enterprise-grade systems like Escrow and AI Fraud Detection.

### ✨ Core Features & Domains

- **🛍️ Order & Inventory Engine**: Handles concurrent checkout flows, preventing atomic overselling via database locking mechanisms.
- **🏦 Escrow & Payments**: Securely holds buyer funds in transit and conditionally releases them to sellers upon confirmed delivery. (Currently being wired to Stripe Connect).
- **🛡️ Fraud Detection**: Analyzes heuristics (IP, velocity, value) to algorithmically score and halt suspicious transactions in real-time.
- **🧠 Recommendation Engine**: Utilizes browsing history and collaborative filtering to deliver personalized product feeds.
- **🔄 Refunds & Returns**: Complex workflows allowing buyers to initiate disputes and request refunds securely.
- **📳 Real-Time Notifications**: Internal dispatcher emitting WebSocket, Email, and SMS alerts for critical lifecycle events.
- **🐇 Queue & Event Backbone**: Bull-backed workers handle emails, recommendation refreshes, and image processing while RabbitMQ fan-out exchanges broadcast domain events for future microservices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (Node.js / TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/))
- **Caching & Rate Limiting**: Redis
- **Testing**: Jest (Unit & E2E) & Supertest

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to spin up your local development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (for spinning up Postgres and Redis easily)

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the Node dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cybermaxi7/MarketX-backend.git
cd MarketX-backend
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

_(Note: As we transition into the open-source phase, we are currently integrating a `docker-compose.yml` to streamline setup)._

For now, assure you have a running **PostgreSQL 15** database and a **Redis** server. Configure your `.env` file at the root of the project with the necessary credentials:

```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=marketx

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# RabbitMQ
AMQP_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672
```

### Local infrastructure (compose profile)

We provide a minimal Docker Compose profile for local development that starts Postgres, Redis and RabbitMQ. See the full instructions in [docs/local-infra.md](docs/local-infra.md).


### 4. Running the App

```bash
# Start the development server (with hot-reload)
$ npm run start:dev

# Start in production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Pull Request Quality Checklist

We require PRs to follow a quality checklist (tests, migration notes, docs). See [docs/pr-checklist.md](docs/pr-checklist.md) for details and use the repository PR template when opening a PR.

Before opening a PR, run the quick confidence suite:

```bash
$ npm run pr:check
```

This command runs the maintained contributor confidence suite: targeted lint checks, targeted TypeScript typechecking, and focused regression tests for the current contribution slice.

## 🧪 Testing

We heavily value test coverage to ensure marketplace stability.

```bash
# Run the quick pre-PR confidence suite
$ npm run pr:check

# Run individual parts of the confidence suite
$ npm run lint:pr
$ npm run typecheck:pr
$ npm run test:pr

# Run the unit test suite
$ npm run test

# Run the full repository TypeScript typecheck
$ npm run typecheck

# Watch mode for Active Test-Driven Development
$ npm run test:watch

# See code coverage report
$ npm run test:cov
```
